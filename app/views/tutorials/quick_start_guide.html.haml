    II. Give students registration code and have students sign up on cloud.edurange.org

  %font{:size => 4}
    In order for students to sign up at cloud.edurange.org, they need a registration code.
    You can find your code on the home tab under the heading,
    "Registration Code:" (It is located below AWS Settings and above User Information, it
    should be an alphanumeric string like '23a6e9k2a5').

    Give this code to your students and have them sign up at cloud.edurange.org. Students will
    need to provide the registration code and a name, email, and password.

  %h3 
    III. Create a student group
  
  %font{:size => 4}
    On your
    %a{ :href => 'https://cloud.edurange.org/instructor'}
      home page,
    scroll down to find
    the blue button called "Create Student Groups". Once your group is created, you should see
    the new empty group under Student Groups, above the default group 'All'.

  %h3 
    IV. Add all students to student group

  %font{:size => 4}
    Once students have registered with the Registration Code you provided them, they should appear
    under the 'All' group. To add them to the new student group you have created, click on the blue
    'add to student group' link located to the right of the student's name and email. Enter the name of 
    your newly created student group to add them to that group.

  %h3 
    V. Create Scenario

  %font{:size => 4}
    Select the 'Scenario' tab at the top of the page. Select the white button 'Load New Scenario'.
    Most scenarios will be listed under 'Production Scenarios'. If you have designed and built
    your own scenarios, those will be listed under 'Custom Scenarios'.

  %h3 
    VI. Add student group to scenario

  %font{:size => 4}
    Now that the scenario is created, scroll down to the section labeled 'Groups'. You should multiple groups. 
    , including Instructor and one or more groups for students. Click the drop down menu next to a group you would
    like add students to, and and select 'Add Student Group'. Input the name of the student group that contains your students. 
    It is important that you add your student <strong>group</strong> before you boot your scenario. If you have already
    booted the scenario, unboot it, add the student group, and the boot it again.

%h3 
  VII. Boot scenario

%font{:size => 4}
  At the top of the scenario page, click the 'Boot' button on the left. The full booting process
  can take anywhere from five minutes on smaller scenarios, to fifteen minutes on the larger 
  scenarios (like recon). Once the scenario is booted and fully initialized, your students should
  be able to use their scenario-specific credentials (which they can see once logged into cloud.edurange.edu), to
  ssh to the NAT instance, which has a public IP address. 
  The instructor can see the credentials for the students and for the instructor under the users tab
  for the scenario.
  <strong>Please unboot scenarios when they are not being used.</strong>  For example, if you are trying out a scenario 
  to prepare for class, you should unboot at the end of a session.
