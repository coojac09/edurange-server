# File Wrangler

This scenario was created to teach the basics of files and directories in the Linux command line. Students will use basic navigation commands to view files and directories and to move around between directories. They will also use commands to create new files and directories and commands for renaming, copying, moving and deleting them. Finally, they will use commands to view and change file permissions.

By the end of this exercise students will be able to:
- print the current working directory
- list the contents of a directory
- view the contents of a file
- move to another directory
- obtain information about directory and file type
- list the contents of a directory with and without hidden files
- look up the manual page for a command
- manipulate files (create, delete, move, and copy)
- manipulate directories (create, delete, move, and copy)
- view permissions for a file or directory
- change permissions for a file or directory
